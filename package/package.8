.SH NAME
package \- maintain local disk configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/package
[
.B \-vnskya

[
.B \-c conf
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Package
maintains files and directories on a machine's local disk
as specified in a configuration file. Each machine using
.I package
is assumes to have access to a distributed filesystem such as
.I "AFS"
from which master copies of files may be fetched.
.I Package
uses file modification times to determine when a file is current or not.
.PP
The format of the configuration file is the following:
.PP
type file [proto] [username[groupname]] [mode] [hash]
.PP
The type field specifies one of B, C, D, F, L, P, S, N standing for
block special device, charactor special device, directory, regular file,
symbolic link, pipe, socket, and "just leave it alone" respectively. Directory type specifications may
also have a following X to specify a lost+found directory or an R to specify
that any extra files not configured in that directory are to be
removed. (Use this
option carefully.)
If the letter T is appended to a directory specification then the username,
groupname and mode given to the directory will also be applied to files and
directories copied from its prototype.
.BR
Similarly the regular file specification may have a
following I to specify that this file is only to be copied into place if
the file is not present, likewise a following O specifies that when a file is
updated the old copy should be renamed with a suffix of .old.
If the letter U is appended to file or directory specifications then 
the update may not be inhibited by file mode.
If the letter W is appended to file or directory specifications then
the update will win a conflict if one exists.
.PP
The file field specifies an absolute path of the local file.
.PP
The proto field specifies a major and minor device number when used in
a block or charactor special device entry or the prefix to used to name
the master file (or real file in the case of a symbolic link.)
If the letter A is appended to update mode then the proto field specifies
an absolute path and does not have the file appended to it to form the path.
If the letter Q is appended to update mode then when this file is updated
.I package
will exit with the status of 4. (This only works for file modes.)
.PP
The username, groupname, and mode are all optional and when not specified
the permissions of the master file are used.
.PP
The hash field is only applicable for files, and only when package is compiled with md5 support enabled.
.PP
Normally the configuration file is named
.I
/etc/package.SYS
where ``SYS'' reflects the actual system type of the machine,
as defined by the
.I /usr/local/bin/sys
program.
Other configuration files may be specified by the
.I c
flag.
However, the actual system type will be supplied by
.I package
and must not be give in the name.
The
.I a
flag causes the cpu type to not be appended to the configuration file name.
.PP
Normally
.I package
prints out what is is doing, unless the
.I s
flag is given.
The
.I v
flag increases the level of verbosity of the output.
.PP
The
.I n
flag is used to tell
.I package
not to do any actual work but instead just tell what it would do. (This
is useful in debugging configuration files.)
.PP
By default, package will not update a file if it exists and
none of the write bits are set.  The
.I y
flag enables updating of these files.
The
.I k
prohibits updating of these files, and is present for compatibility.
