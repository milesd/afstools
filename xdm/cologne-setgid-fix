Yes, seen and fixed (just yesterday... ;-)).
The AFS authenticating xdm inserts the pag data into the first two
slots [0,1]  of the group array. Later on (in session.c), a setgid
is done with argument groups[0]. This will always set your primary group to
the first part of the pag data.
We replaced the setgid call in session.c by the following code:
#ifdef AFS
        if (verify->ngroups > 2 && verify->groups[0] > 32767)
          setgid (verify->groups[2]);
        else
          setgid (verify->groups[0]);
#else
        setgid (verify->groups[0]);
#endif

At least this works for us...

Best regards, Axel
