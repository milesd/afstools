At RPI we have modified xdm to do this (and fixed some other things at
the same time..)

You can find our code in:

We have modifed rexecd to do the right thing (well, relatively.. I am
still not happy at a clear-text connection passing your passwrod
around.. but who can modify macX...)  I have forwarded your message to
the person who did that work.
