Subject: AFS/kerberized version of XDM

   The version of XDM that you have from RPI in your contrib space is now
out of date.  It has a minor (well...) bug under AIX 3.2.x where after
16 logins, it will no longer be able to get a PAG, and will then just toss
any tokens that it gets.  It still authenticates under AFS, but you have
no access to your home directory.  There is a new version in
/afs/rpi.edu/campus/session/xdm/2.0/distrib/src that deals with this problem,
and is otherwise identical to the previous.
