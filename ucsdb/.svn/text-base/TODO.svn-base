Replace system() by exec().

Use getopt() for option parsing.

If local CellServDB does not exist, create it.

Look if mount point already exists.

Handle duplicate entries in one file as well.

No check for correct mount points in /afs. -m and -u synchronize only
with CellServDB, not with actual directory of mount points.

Perform some operation on the old file. (Prior to overwrite.)
Mv, cp, rm, ci,... come to mind. This should be configurable at
runtime.

Support multiple extension files.

Put all those parameters in a configuration file.
