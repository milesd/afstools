\chapter{Reauth:  Periodically Renew AFS Authentication

}
\section{What Reauth is

}\leftindent{
\bold{Reauth} provides a way for time-intensive programs which would normally 
lose AFS authentication after 25 hours to renew that authentication without 
direct user intervention.  Postman, for example, uses reauth.

}
\section{Quick reference

}\leftindent{
\bold{Syntax:}


\leftindent{reauth \italic{time} \italic{userid} <\italic{password}>}


where \italic{time} is in seconds, \italic{userid} is the userid of the person 
running the program, and \italic{password} is the user's password. If a 
password is not specified on the command line, it is read from the terminal.


\bold{Errors:}  reauth sends errors to the console device.  Possible error 
messages are:


\leftindent{\bold{Password too long:}  \italic{len}   The password entered was 
of length \italic{len} and exceeds the maximum length of 64.


\bold{fork failed}}}:   \leftindent{\leftindent{\bold{reauth} was unable to 
place itself in the background and cannot execute. The reason will appear on 
the previous line.


\bold{Unable to authenticate to AFS because}: \italic{\bold{reason}}: the AFS 
authentication failed because of the given reason.  The most common reason 
would be an incorrect password.

}}
\section{How Reauth works}

\leftindent{
When first run, \bold{reauth} authenticates, and then places itself in the 
background and sleeps until the specified time has elapsed.  It then attempts 
to reauthenticate the user on the file system.  If it succeeds, then it again 
goes to sleep and repeats the process indefinitely.  If it fails  then it will 
retry every 5 minutes until it does succeed.

}
\section{Warnings

}\leftindent{
Running \bold{reauth} from shell scripts can pose security problems if the 
program is run with the password on the command line. Although it is zero'd 
out, some systems do not honor this attempt to remove it from a \italic{ps} 
listing.


\bold{Reauth} never terminates and can only be killed manually or by rebooting 
the workstation.


The only situations in which \bold{reauth} should be necessary are those in 
which the program will run longer than the lifetime of the authentication 
(usually 25 hours), the program \italic{must} be authenticated, and the user 
cannot be present.  

}
\section{Advice

}\leftindent{
Since authentication normally lasts for 25 hours, it is usually unnecessary to 
run \bold{reauth} much more than that, though a value of around 12 hours 
(43200 seconds) is acceptable.


Since \bold{reauth} is equivalent to manually running \italic{klog}, users are 
encourage to do so, if possible.
