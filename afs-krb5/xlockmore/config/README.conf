These files are just examples of configuration files for xlock and
other tools which I use.  They are not normally required.

fortune.dat is for those who do not have fortune.  On VMS it is very costly
  to spawn a process.
openwin* and system.fvwmrc.* is for openwin and fvwm window managers.
*play* is fro sound.
*flag* stuff is for building flags (many of which are made already in flags)
*life* stuff is for adding life patterns to life.c not all formats are
   handled.  However, the major one that isn't is close to the format I use.
xlockrandimage.pl picks a random image.  Does not have to be used since
  it is built in, one can just give a directory name.

xlocksat.pl  use like "xlock -saturation `xlocksat.pl`"  The idea is that
  high saturation looks weird at night and low saturation looks weird
  during the day.  Unfortuantely, as the day progresses the saturation does
  not change.
xlockranddur.pl  use like "xlock random -duration `xlockranddur.pl`"
  This gives a random duration of a mode (providing you have fortune).
