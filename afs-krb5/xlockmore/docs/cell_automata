There are a few modes devoted to cellular automata.
I also added a bunch of options.  So I am providing a little explaination
so it is not overwhelming.

The modes are ant, bug, demon, life, life1d, life3d, wator, wire.
use -install if netscape is stealing all your colors... :)
"xlock -help" may be helpful too.

ant: Turing Machines where the tape is the screen.
 Special options:
  -truchet: this shows the path (good to use with -size at
    least 10)  Truchet option turned off if its not Turk's ants.

 Mode options:
  -batchcount <int>: number of ants
  -size <int>: size of ant in pixels
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many cycles before a new ant
  
  -neighbors <int>: 0 random, 4 ants, 6 bees
  -v: verbose help identify ant  (good to use with -inwindow or -debug)

bug: Evolving bugs learn to walk straight (except in the garden)
 Mode options:
  -batchcount <int>: number of bugs
  -size <int>: size of bug in pixels
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many cycles before a new world

demon:
 Mode options:
  -batchcount <int>: number of states
  -size <int>: size of cell in pixels
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many cycles before a new screen

  -neighbors <int>: 0 random, 4 rectangular, 6 hexagonal

life:
 Special options:
  -rule <int>: where the integer has 4 digits conforming to the parameters
     <living_min><living_max><birth_min><birth_max>, so Conway's rule
     is 2333.  This unfortuantely makes the artificial constraint that
     the parameters are contiguous.

 Mode options:
  -batchcount <int>: number of cycles before glider (if one exists)
  -size <int>: size of cell in pixels
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many cycles before a new lifeform

  -v: verbose help identify life (to be referenced with the source code)
     (good to use with -inwindow or -debug)

life1d: 1 dimensional life
 Special options:
  -totalistic: (default) totalistic 1d life
  +totalistic: LCAU collection  These rules may not be symmetric and are
    more general.

 Mode options:
  -size <int>: size of cell in pixels
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many pages before a new lifeform

  -v: verbose help identify life (to be referenced with the source code)
     (good to use with -inwindow or -debug)

life3d: 3 dimensional life
 Special options:
  -rule3d <int>: where the integer has 4 digits conforming to the parameters
     <living_min><living_max><birth_min><birth_max>.  2 rules with gliders
     are 4555 & 5766, to other good rules are 5655 & 6767.  This
     unfortuantely makes the artificial constraint that the parameters are
     contiguous.

 Mode options:
  -batchcount <int>: number of cycles before glider (if one exists)
  -size <int>: size of cell in pixels
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many cycles before a new lifeform

  -v: verbose help identify life (to be referenced with the source code)
     (good to use with -inwindow or -debug)

wator: sharks and fish on a water torus planet
 Mode options:
  -batchcount <int>: breed time for the fish
  -size <int>: size of cell in pixels (sharks and fish become squares
    and circles)
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many cycles before a new world starts

wire: (this lacks a good circuit generator)
 Mode options:
  -batchcount <int>: length of random circuit
  -size <int>: size of cell in pixels
  -delay <int>: controls the length of a cycle in microsec
  -cycles <int>: how many cycles before a circuit
