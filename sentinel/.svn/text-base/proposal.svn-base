This program will be built directly on the libfsprobe.a layer.  There
is no need to use libgtx.a (gator) because it only currently provides
curses support and does not actually do any monitoring.

Have a config file that specifies what servers to monitor and the
exact thresholds for each.  I'd like some more input on the config
file since it is the true interface to what the program will monitor.

Automatically update daily by re-reading the config file if it has
changed.  Also, allow for a manual re-read.  Because this will force a
shutdown and restart of fsprobe_Init(), all previous data will be
reset and should probably store previous data in a log file.  May want
to do this daily, anyway.

Allow the user to force an immediate probe since this functionality is
allowed by the given library.

The program would almost certainly be button-driven rather than
menu-driven.

Create three modes:
	supervisor mode:
		A general "everything's okay/not okay" indicator.
		This would be a small window.  As soon as something
		became "not okay", the window would expand and switch
		to trouble mode.  If something is already "not okay",
		and something new happened, it would still switch to
		trouble mode.

	trouble mode:
		This would be a grid containing the names of all
		currently monitored servers.  This mode would bring up
		details on all current sources of trouble.  If a
		server is having any sort of problems, its name would
		be highlighted and any associated data would be
		displayed.  It would cover most of the screen in order
		to attract attention.

	nitpicker mode:
		Give stats on everything.  This would display pretty
		much everything about every server under observation.

	In addition, there would be an event log window with a scroll
	bar recording what and when things went wrong/got better.
